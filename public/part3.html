In Part 3, XXX. <strong>Above:</strong> DFormer president Lyndon Johnson congratulates Dallas Cowboys coach Tom Landry on his team’s victory over the San Francisco 49ers in the 1972 NFC championship game. Johnson watched the game with Clint Murchison’s Jr. in Murchison’s suite. (The Associated Press)</p>

<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">B</span>y the late 1960s, the press estimated Dallasite Clint Murchison Sr.’s net worth was put at at $500 million. He owned banks, insurance companies, a publishing house, Daisy Air Rifle, Field & Stream magazine, drive-in movie theaters, hotels, pipelines and oil companies. His homes were in Dallas and La Jolla, Calif., on a private island in Mexico, at the Acuña ranch and on a cliff above Acapulco Bay.</p>

<p>But his private world had shrunk to the 5,278-acre Gladoak Farms, a retreat near his East Texas hometown of Athens. Felled by a series of small strokes, Murchison required a wheelchair. Married servants Eula Mae and Warren Tilley were there to care for him.</p>

<p>The business reins were in the hands of his sons, <span class="gloss" data-entry="Clint Jr. and John Murchison">John and Clint Jr.</span>, who dutifully followed his paradigm: Finance projects with borrowed money. Let inflation increase their value. Sell. Repeat.</p>

<p>As adults, they had controlling interest in the homebuilder Centex, a string of insurance companies and real estate developments from Hawaii to Florida. But one asset kept the Murchison name in the news: They owned the Dallas Cowboys.</p>

<p>Away from the office, John had a plantation in Georgia and Clint Jr. a penthouse on Park Avenue. Wheelchair-bound, their father could no longer navigate his 22,000-square-foot Dallas mansion. He relinquished it to John and his wife, Lupe.</p>

<p>On 25 acres on Forest Lane, Clint Jr. built a 43,500-square-foot, one-story house from limestone quarried at his father’s ranch in Mexico.</p>

<p>During its construction, he saw a friend about to hunt at <span class="gloss" data-entry="Acuña">Acuña.</span></p>

<p>“Could you take a message and have them send up another 17,000 rocks?” Clint Jr. asked.</p>

<p>But there was no Texas swagger, no braggadocio. As children, they watched their mother die from hepatitis and their kid brother from pneumonia. As teens, John left Dallas for Hotchkiss, then Yale, and Clint Jr. for Lawrenceville prep, then MIT. They were shy, detached and intensely intellectual. Despite their mental prowess and financial acumen, Murchison Sr. and his sons would repeatedly learn the same lesson: Wealth and influence have no power over illness and tragedy.</p>

</div>

<p>The firm, Murchison Brothers, occupied the entire 23rd floor of the 50-story First National Bank Building. John and his wife, Lupe, collected contemporary art that filled the walls. A prank-prone Clint Jr. would stand on his head and examine a Helen Frankenthaler or a Mark Rothko.</p>

<p>“It looks better this way,” he said. he’d say.</p>

<p>The receptionist answered with only, “Seven four one six oh three one.”</p>

<p>“Murchisons Thrive on Anonymity,” read a New York Times headline.</p>

<p>America believed that Clint Jr. owned the Cowboys. It was his creation and his passion. But like most of their ventures, it was owned jointly with John.</p>

<p>“I think I bumped into John Murchison twice,” said Gil Brandt, Cowboys director of player personnel from 1959 to 1989.</p>

<p>The team perplexed Murchison Sr., who thought it would be a perpetual money loser.</p>

<p>On Christmas Eve 1967, he was startled by how much was at risk. At Gladoaks, he watched the TV news. His trademark cigarette holder was between his fingers and a lit cigarette had a lengthy ash. A news anchor said Clint Jr. planned to move the Dallas Cowboys from the Cotton Bowl to Irving.</p>

<p>The new stadium would cost $15 million.</p>

<p>“That’s going to break that boy,” Murchison Sr. said.</p>

<p>Eighteen months later, as stadium construction began, Clint Murchison Sr. was hospitalized in East Texas. That first night, his wife, <span class="gloss" data-entry="Virginia Murchison">Virginia “Ginny” Murchison</span>, left him with one of their staff members, Leon Williams. She went back to Gladoaks to sleep.</p>

<p>In the early morning hours of June 20, 1969, Murchison Sr. said, “I want to talk with Ginny. Leon, do you have a dime? I need a dime to call Ginny.”</p>

<p>Moments later, he was dead.</p>

<p>He was 74.</p>

<p>On Oct. 24, 1971, the Cowboys began play in Texas Stadium.</p>

<p>The cost? About $30 million.</p>

<p>It was one of the great successes in Clint Jr.’s career.</p>

<p>There were 178 air-conditioned luxury Circle Suites. In them, high-dollar fans watched from comfy chairs as waiters served cocktails.</p>

<p>At the 50-yard line, Clint Jr. had a double suite. His brother John faced him from the opposite side of the stadium.</p>

<p>Democratic National Committee chairman Bob Strauss loved John’s suite. “Get me the hell out of here, Murchison,” he joked. “You’re ruining my reputation as a Democrat.”</p>

<p>The first season in Irving climaxed on Jan. 2, 1972, when the Cowboys played the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship Game.</p>

<p>Clint Jr., small and trim with a crew cut, wore his horn-rimmed glasses. Next to him was former President <span class="gloss" data-entry="Lyndon Johnson">Lyndon Johnson</span> in a dark pinstripe suit. Johnson had been politically associated with the Murchisons since 1940.</p>

<p>During LBJ’s 1948 Senate run, aides like <span class="gloss" data-entry="John Connally">John Connally</span> would visit Murchison Sr.’s Dallas house and oilman <span class="gloss" data-entry="Sid Richardson">Sid Richardson’s</span> private island for envelopes with up to $50,000 in campaign cash.</p>

<p>When the 1948 primary polls closed, opponent Coke Stevenson was ahead by 112 votes. Five days later, Alice, Texas, delivered new votes from Box 13. Johnson won the election by 87 votes and earned a nickname he loathed: Landslide Lyndon.</p>

<p>The Box 13 count was thought to be a fraud, courtesy of South Texas political boss George Parr — the Duke of Duval County.</p>

<p>That story was lodged in the memory of Clint Murchison Jr.</p>

<p>During the 1972 NFC Championship Game, the fourth quarter began with Dallas 7, San Francisco 3.</p>

<p>Johnson watched as quarterback Roger Staubach moved the Cowboys 80 yards. Just before the Cowboys’ touchdown, Clint Jr. leaned toward LBJ and said, “Here come the Duval County results.”</p>

<p class="subhead">Paradise found</p>

<p>As a teenager in 19XXs Dallas, Clint Jr. set three lofty goals: Attend MIT, buy a private island and own a pro football team.</p>

<p>After his World War II service, he earned a master’s at MIT. In 1952, he bought a 2½-mile long island in the Bahamas called <span class="gloss" data-entry="Spanish Cay">Spanish Cay</span> (pronounced “key”). It had six lush beaches that were protected from Atlantic swells by a barrier reef a mile offshore. There was a storm-safe harbor for a small fleet of boats. For aesthetic beauty, it had a dense grove of coconut palm trees — hundreds that reached 30 feet high and made a canopy. For the next? two years, barges arrived with equipment and materials to build an isolated kingdom.</p>

<p>His son Clint Murchison III called the logistics daunting. “Everything,” he said, “was shipped over from the mainland of the United States.”</p>

<p>Dense vegetation was cut away and a 5,000-foot runway was built. A powerhouse was erected to hold generators. Cables for electricity and pipes for sewage and water were buried under a new central road. Uphill from the palm grove, a 14,000-square-foot, mid-century modern house, designed by Clint Jr., was built with floor-to-ceiling windows on all sides. The commercial-grade kitchen featured a cavernous pantry and a large liquor storage room.</p>

<p>To staff this idyll, separate housing was built for servants.</p>

<p>Lambert’s, a Dallas landscape firm, turned the rough-looking island into a green sanctuary with acres of St. Augustine grass.</p>

<p>It was Clint Jr.’s tropical home.</p>

<p class="subhead">Rocky Mountain high</p>

<p>In 1959, John Murchison found the opposite 100 miles west of Denver. He rode a tractor up a mountainside with his Yale classmate George Caulkins. At 11,000 feet, they looked at the forest and at the valley below. As Caulkins explained, it could be a mountain for skiing. An avid snow skier, John Murchison agreed. He soon wrote a check and became one of the original founders of the new resort.</p>

<p>It was called Vail.</p>

<p>Dallas architect Bud Ogelsby designed a five-story masterpiece for Lupe and John. It was both a ski home and an architectural paradigm shift.</p>

<p>The top floor rested on a plateau. Below it, four more floors were suspended down a cliff that served as an interior wall.</p>

<p>Masses of glass provided views in three directions.</p>

<p>As Clint Jr. hosted glamorous guests in the tropics, John did the same in the mountains. He welcomed artists, financiers and the president of the United States.</p>

<p class="subhead">“He’s a no good …”</p>

<p>By January 1960, Clint Jr. was in Miami for// in pursuit of his third goal. There, at an NFL owners’ meeting, the heads of the 12 teams had two quandaries. First: A new commissioner was needed to replace the recently deceased Bert Bell. Second: An ambitious 36-year-old named Clint Murchison Jr. wanted a team for Dallas.</p>

<p>As the days passed without answers, Clint Jr.’s first football employee, Tex Schramm, former GM of the Los Angeles Rams, paced his room.</p>

<p>Quandary One was solved when Schramm’s protégé, 33-year-old Pete Rozelle, was made commissioner. Schramm once hired him to be PR director of the Rams. After Schramm left the team to go to CBS Sports, Rozelle became the GM.</p>

</div>

<p>But for a team in Dallas, there was resistance.</p>

<p>George Preston Marshall, owner of the Washington Redskins, did not want Clint Jr.</p>

<p>“I don’t think the owners saw a power like Clint coming,” said <span class="gloss" data-entry="Gil Brandt">Brandt</span>. “They were like a poker group that played every Tuesday for 40 years. Why do we need anybody else?”</p>

<p>When speaking to the other owners, Marshall planned to use a Senate tactic to block an appointment. He would declare Clint Jr. “personally obnoxious.”</p>

<p>“If he thinks I’m obnoxious now,” Clint Jr. joked, “how will he feel when he meets me?”</p>

<p>Clint Jr. had his own Washington, D.C., ruse.</p>

<p>He got his lobbyist, former FBI agent Tom Webb, to buy the copyright to the Washington fight song, “Hail to the Redskins!” from its composer Barnee Breeskin.</p>

<p>In Miami, a polite Clint Jr. knocked on Marshall’s hotel door at 8 a.m. “No one else would introduce us,” Clint Jr. said. “So here I am.”</p>

<p>“Say Clint,” Marshall said, “there’s a fellow working for you who has my song.”</p>

<p>“You’re kidding,” Clint Jr. said. “Who is it?”</p>

<p>Webb had been advised that a telephone charade was planned. He waited in his office. From Marshall’s room, Clint Jr. called. Per instructions, Webb said nothing, while his boss gave a one-man performance.</p>

<p>“If you’ll agree to let him have the rights to that song,” Clint Jr. said, “he’ll give us the vote. (Pause) I know you think he’s a no good son of a bitch, but this franchise means a lot to me. (Pause) Come on, Tom, be reasonable. I don’t know what he’s ever done to you, but please. (Pause) Oh, good Tom, I really appreciate your doing this. I really want to get into pro football.”</p>

<p>“Tom gave George the song,” Clint said later. “George gave me his vote for admission into the NFL and I gave Barnee 2,000 bucks.”</p>

<p class="subhead">NFL’s TV dollars</p>

<p>To the Murchisons, football was a balance-sheet asterisk.</p>

<p>But new NFL Commissioner Rozelle had a plan to raise the stakes. The NFL would negotiate a network TV contract and distribute the revenue evenly to every team.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1961, <span class="gloss" data-entry="Tex Schramm">Schramm</span> was the host on <span class="gloss" data-entry="Spanish Cay">Spanish Cay</span>. His guests included New York Giants co-owner Wellington Mara and 49ers manager Lou Spadia.</p>

<p>In New York, CBS Sports president Bill MacPhail, Schramm’s former boss, needed to make the deal with Rozelle, Schramm’s former employee.</p>

<p>The plan: CBS would pay $9.3 million to broadcast games.</p>

<p>“At about 6 at night, a ship-to-shore call comes that we got the TV contract,” said <span class="gloss" data-entry="Gil Brandt">Brandt</span>. “It was like we just won the lottery. The first thing we did was open the Dom Perignon.”</p>

<p>But the celebration proved premature.</p>

<p class="subhead">Quarterback sneak</p>

<p>A federal judge quickly ruled that for one network to broadcast all NFL games was a violation of anti-trust laws.</p>

<p>Within weeks, however, Brooklyn’s Rep. Emanuel “Manny” Cellar introduced a bill to exempt pro football, baseball, basketball and hockey from a TV anti-trust conundrum.</p>

<p>With startling speed, it was approved by the House and Senate. In October 1961, President John F. Kennedy signed it. The CBS-NFL deal was reinstated.</p>

<p>So, what was Manny Celler’s interest?</p>

<p>It took a few years to unravel the question.</p>

<p>A 1965 Senate investigation of longtime LBJ aide Bobby Baker revealed that, also in August 1961, Celler’s law firm had paid Baker a $2,500 referral fee for some business. Baker, a friend of Clint Jr. and Tom Webb, had brought a Dallas company called Sweetwater Development to Celler’s firm for $10,000 of legal help.</p>

<p>Sweetwater’s owner?</p>

<p><span class="gloss" data-entry="Clint Jr. and John Murchison">Murchison Brothers</span>.</p>

<p>The Senate investigation failed to note that the $10,000 fee from a Murchison company and the NFL/TV exemption bill happened within days of each other.</p>

<p>Also unnoticed by investigators: The short list of incorporators of Sweetwater Development included Edward W. LeBaron Jr.</p>

<p>The public knew him as Eddie LeBaron.</p>

<p>In 1961, he was the starting quarterback of the Dallas Cowboys.</p>

</div>

<p class="subhead">“Dear Lyndon…”</p>

<p>In 1966, Celler, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, was more restrained. His committee needed to OK a new bill from Louisiana’s Hale Boggs to exempt the merger of the NFL and the AFL from anti-trust laws.</p>

<p>Clint Jr. dropped a note to the White House: “Dear Lyndon, Although Congressman Celler has publicly and privately encouraged a merger, he seems reluctant to report out Hale Boggs’ bill to legalize the merger. I know a call from Pennsylvania Avenue wouldn’t hurt and it might help Dallas win the championship.”</p>

<p>The committee reported it out and the bill passed.</p>

<p>Louisiana Sen. Russell Long pushed it through the Senate. Then <span class="gloss" data-entry="Lyndon Johnson">LBJ</span> signed it. The leagues merged and the Super Bowl was created.</p>

<p>In January 1971, the Cowboys were in Super Bowl V. Clint Jr. planned to fly his family and guests directly from <span class="gloss" data-entry="Spanish Cay">Spanish Cay</span> to the game in Miami. Among the island VIPs was Sen. Long and former Sen. Howard Edmondson.</p>

<p>Seeing Spanish Cay’s splendor, Long said, “Howard, I don’t know what tax loophole Clint uses for this place, but let’s try not to screw it up.”</p>

<p class="subhead">John’s exit strategy</p>

<p>John Murchison knew better than anyone what could screw up the entire Murchison world: Debt. Both he and Clint Jr. had followed their father’s dictum to borrow enormous sums and let inflation increase the value of their holdings.</p>

<p>John liked conservative deals, but Clint Jr. had a reckless streak. He also had a habit of backing bad projects from questionable associates.</p>

<p>By the late 1970s, interest rates began a frightening rise toward 20 percent. Murchison Brothers was saddled with enormous debt and many illiquid assets.</p>

<p>John wanted out.</p>

<p>In 1978, John and Clint Jr. signed a dissolution agreement. Although it might take years to untangle, <span class="gloss" data-entry="Clint Jr. and John Murchison">Murchison Brothers</span>, the entity created by their father in 1942, would end.</p>

<p>“I’d like to phase down my own personal activity in business and get my affairs to a point where I didn’t have to have any crises that I have to attend to,” John said.</p>

<p>At home, he wrestled with his propensity toward emotional detachment from his own children.</p>

<p>He made an effort with his youngest.</p>

<p>Barbara Jeanne Murchison had just graduated from his alma mater, Yale. She returned to Dallas and her fiancé, John Coffman.</p>

<p>In June 1979, she drove her parents to the Dallas/Fort Worth Airport to catch the supersonic Concorde to Paris.</p>

<p>In an era when people without a ticket could go to the gate, Barbara walked through the airport with her parents.</p>

<p>She and John stared through the window and marveled at the Concorde. As part of his attempt to quit smoking, he reached for a stick of gum.</p>

<p>When she turned to leave, she was startled by the words from her once-distant father.</p>

<p>“Do you have to go now?” he asked.</p>

<p>So, Barbara stayed.</p>

<p>Then her glamorous parents boarded the Concorde and flew away for a quick trip.</p>

<p>The next Thursday, the plane returned them at 3 p.m. John had barely enough time to go home and change into a suit.</p>

<p>Outside was his silver Porsche 928, a Christmas surprise from Lupe.</p>

<p>He was the new president of the board of the Boy Scouts of America and committed to speak to 25 Boy Scouts supporters at the Highland Park mansion of Gov. Bill Clements. He got in his car and drove south to the grand Clements’ mansion on the banks of Exall Lake.</p>

<p>After dinner, John rose to speak. But he soon stopped.</p>

<p>“I’m having difficulty breathing,” he said. “I’ll cut it short, if you don’t mind.”</p>

<p>Since his time as a World War II fighter pilot, asthma had plagued him.</p>

<p>He sat down briefly and then left the room. Outside, the governor and King Ranch heir Bobby Shelton found him headed to the Porsche to take himself to the hospital. Clements asked State Trooper William Essler, part of the governor’s detail, to take him in a Highway Patrol car instead. Shelton got in the front and John in the back.</p>

<p>At 9 p.m., Essler turned on his red lights and siren and pulled out past John’s parked Porsche.</p>

<p>He turned south on Preston and John lay down.</p>

<p>South of Armstrong Parkway, Preston Road morphed into Oak Lawn. There, John’s breathing became shallow. Shelton turned around, got up on his knees and reached over to loosen John’s tie.</p>

<p>With the siren blaring loudly, Essler ran the red light at Avondale.</p>

<p>A woman driving east went through the green light and hit the trooper’s passenger doors hard. Both cars were disabled. Essler and Shelton had no injuries. John was unmarked. He was also unconscious.</p>

<p>Essler called an ambulance.</p>

<p class="subhead">Life’s intersection</p>

<p><span class="gloss" data-entry="John Coffman">John Coffman</span> had just picked up <span class="gloss" data-entry="Barbara Murchison">Barbara Murchison</span> for a party hosted by her cousin Hara Hunt. In Coffman’s powder blue Mercedes sedan, the couple drove north on Oak Lawn. Near Avondale, they saw an ambulance and a terrible car wreck.</p>

<p>In the summer night air, the state troopers stood like statues.</p>

<p>“John, what happened?” B.J. asked her fiancé.</p>

<p>Coffman didn’t know. He kept driving. Five blocks later, he turned on Hawthorne and the couple went to the party. In 30 minutes, Barbara was called to the phone.</p>

<p>“Barbara Jeanne, you need to come to St. Paul,” said her sister Mary Noel Lamont. “Dad’s been in an accident.”</p>

<p>At the entrance to the ER, Barbara was met by her brother, John Murchison Jr., who told her the news.</p>

<p>Their father, age 57, was dead.</p>

<p class="subhead">Nothing more to say</p>

<p>To combat his social awkwardness, Clint Jr. had been a heavy drinker who named his yacht The Morning After.</p>

<p>But in 1976, he stopped.</p>

<p>For several years, Lupe and her children tried to disentangle John’s estate from <span class="gloss" data-entry="Murchison Brothers">Murchison Brothers</span>. As the acrimony increased, Clint Jr. began to physically wobble. “I would watch him walk down the hall of the office for the restroom,” said his assistant Ruth Woodard. “He’d be touching the wall with this fingertips to keep his balance.”</p>

<p>He became to stammer and stutter.</p>

<p>“D-d-did you n-n-notice this didn’t start getting bad until I quit drinking?” he told a friend.</p>

<p>In 1982, he was diagnosed with olivopontine cerebellar atrophy, a rare degenerative nerve illness, similar to Lou Gehrig’s disease.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1983, Clint Jr. invited <span class="gloss" data-entry="Tex Schramm">Tex Schramm</span> to the big house on Forest Lane.</p>

<p>“I’ve got problems with that particular part of my brain, which gives me speech and equilibrium problems,” he said. “I will go through a slow but irreversible deterioration.”</p>

<p>John’s heirs pressed him for liquidity. A list of banks pondered litigation against Clint Jr., a man Forbes magazine said was worth $350 million.</p>

<p>He had one move left.</p>

<p>The Dallas Cowboys, he told Schramm, were for sale.</p>

<p>The following year, Dallasite Bum Bright headed an investor group that bought the team and the stadium for $80 million.</p>

<p>“I negotiated with Tex Schramm,” said Jim Francis, who was operations officer of Bright and Company. “Clint was so ill, it was hard to understand his words.”</p>

<p>Half of the proceeds went to John’s side of the family. They were largely indemnified from litigation against Clint Jr.</p>

<p>Even while immobilized in a wheelchair and faced with the loss of everything, he had not lost his humor.</p>

<p>One day, his close friend Steve Schneider sat with him.</p>

<p>“Clint, remember back when you could talk to me, but you wouldn’t?” he said. “Now that you can’t talk, aren’t you sorry that you didn’t?”</p>

<p>With a mischievous glint in his eye, Clint Jr. breathed deeply, focused his energy and said, “No!”</p>

<p class="subhead">Lights in the island dark</p>

<p>For 30 years, Clint Jr. added amenities to <span class="gloss" data-entry="Spanish Cay">Spanish Cay</span>. But he never added runway lights.</p>

<p>Take-offs and landings were for daytime only.</p>

<p>During the off-season, when island manager Paul Reinholm was in Florida, his son, Robert, lived on the island in a staff house with its own generator. There was no reason to run the powerhouse and light anything else on Spanish Cay.</p>

<p>On that small island, 160 miles from Florida, Robert was alone.</p>

<p>One night, Robert awoke to the sound of airplanes. In a Jeep, he drove to the north end of Spanish Cay and found all 5,000 feet of airstrip outlined by military-style portable lights.</p>

<p>Drug traffickers with machine guns spotted him. In a rare moment of drug-runner diplomacy, they merely signaled for him to shoo. Drugs were removed from planes and loaded on speedboats.</p>

<p>In Dallas, Clint Jr. was silent. He was in bankruptcy, unable to control sovereignty over anything but his thoughts.</p>

<p>On March 30, 1987, at age 63, he died.</p>

<p class="subhead">Remembrance of things past</p>

<p>After the 1969 death of Murchison Sr., the vaqueros at <span class="gloss" data-entry="Acuña">Acuña</span> built a 15-foot cross from two big pieces of wood.</p>

<p>They hauled it up the brushy path to the top of Mariquita Mountain. There, they could look down on Hacienda Acuña.</p>

</div>

<p>To secure the cross, a deep hole? was dug.</p>

<p>In that hole, they first placed a pair of his favorite boots. Then, they raised the cross.</p>

<p>On it, was an inscription: “Clint W. Murchison, Nunca nos olvidaremos de el!” [“We will never forget him.”]</p>

<p>For decades, the cross was visible from the house.</p>

<p>Finally, it was struck by lightning, burned and disappeared.</p>

<p>As a widow, <span class="gloss" data-entry="Virgina Murchison">Virginia Murchison</span> entertained at Hacienca Acuña for 27 years. In 1996, she hosted a Thanksgiving gathering at the ranch with Clint Jr.’s sons Burk and Robert and their wives and children.</p>

<p>Burk climbed Mariquita.</p>

<p>“I found the remnants of the cross,” he said. “I found the brass stanchion that held it together and I brought it down.”</p>

<p>On Christmas Day 1996, Virginia died.</p>

<p>In 2001, the family sold Acuña. That year, Burk was the last Murchison at Acuña. He returned to secure a painting by Arthur Elliott that dominated the living room. It depicted a young and smiling Virginia Murchison in a colorful Mexican vestida.</p>

<p>“The painting,” said Burk, “is still in the family.”</p>
