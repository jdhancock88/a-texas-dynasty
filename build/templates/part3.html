<p class="precede"><strong>Third in a three-part sequel to Islands of the Oil Kings: </strong>Clint Murchison Sr. was one of the wealthiest men in America. But his name became almost forgotten, overshadowed by his sons’ best-known asset: the Dallas Cowboys. Deal-making and political prowess learned from their father helped the brothers land the team and grow the Murchison empire. But tragedies loomed in their futures. <strong>Above:</strong> Former president Lyndon Johnson congratulates Dallas Cowboys coach Tom Landry on his team’s victory over the San Francisco 49ers in the 1972 NFC championship game. Johnson watched the game with Clint Murchison’s Jr. in Murchison’s suite. (The Associated Press)</p>

<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n the 1960s, Dallasite Clint Murchison Sr.’s net worth was put at $500 million. He owned banks, insurance companies, a publishing house, Daisy Air Rifle, <em>Field & Stream</em> magazine, drive-in movie theaters, hotels, pipelines and oil companies. His homes were in Dallas, La Jolla, Calif., and in Mexico — on an island, the Acuña ranch and on a cliff above Acapulco Bay.</p>

<p>His private world had shrunk to the 5,278-acre Gladoak Farms, a retreat near his East Texas hometown of Athens. Felled by a series of small strokes, Murchison required a wheelchair. Married staffers Eula Mae and Warren Tilley were there to care for him.</p>

<p>The business reins were in the hands of his sons, John and Clint Jr., who dutifully followed his paradigm: Finance projects with borrowed money. Let inflation increase their value. Sell, then repeat.</p>

<p>On live TV, Edward R. Murrow once asked Murchison Sr. to talk about cash.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know too much about it, I’ve never had any,” Murchison Sr. said. “Cash makes a man careless,” was one of his aphorisms.</p>

<p>As adults, his sons had controlling interest in the homebuilder Centex, a string of insurance companies and real estate developments from Hawaii to Florida.</p>

<p>The public just knew that they owned the Dallas Cowboys.</p>

<section class="contentWell">

<p>John had a plantation in Georgia and Clint Jr. a penthouse on Park Avenue. Their father could no longer navigate his 22,000-square-foot Dallas mansion. He relinquished it to John and his wife, Lupe, and took their one-story home.</p>

<p>On 25 acres on Forest Lane, Clint Jr. built a 43,500-square-foot house from limestone quarried at his father’s ranch in Mexico.</p>

<p>During its construction, he saw a friend about to leave for a hunting trip to Acuña.</p>

<p>“Could you take a message and have them send up another 17,000 rocks?” he asked.</p>

<p>Despite the opulence, there was no swagger. This was not the life they had planned.</p>

<p>They were boys when their mother and brother died. Intensely intellectual, they grew into shy, detached men. John’s time as a World War II fighter pilot left him asthmatic and prone to nervous exhaustion.</p>

<p>After Yale, he began a quiet life in Santa Fe. He and his wife, Lupe, had a hillside adobe home near a pig farm. After their son, John Jr., was born, Murchison Sr. and his wife, Virginia, came to visit. “There were pigs all over the hillside,” Lupe recalled. “When we greeted John’s dad, I was wearing a Mexican dress. John was wearing a Mexican shirt and sandals. We were very happy. But Pop took one look at us and the house and said, ‘You’re packing right now and coming back to Dallas.’”</p>

<p>In Boston, Clint Jr. had a home with his wife, Jane, and their son, Clint III. At MIT, he got his masters in mathematics. For strangers, his silent stare was unnerving. Evenings were spent with grad students talking mathematical theories.</p>

<p>MIT offered him a teaching position. But he got a letter from Dallas.</p>

<p>It read, “Come on home. Love, Dad.”</p>

<p>Clint Jr., Jane and Clint III moved to Dallas.</p>

</div>

<p>“That decision represented the beginning of the end for Dad,” said Clint Jr.’s son Burk Murchison. “He wanted to teach.”</p>

<p>John’s daughter Barbara Coffman had a similar refrain.</p>

<p>“Dad and Uncle Clint parlayed what their father had done,” she said. “That whole business life was stressful. Mom thought Dad should have been a teacher.”</p>

<p><em>The New York Times</em> devoted many stories to the brothers’ financial acumen. But financial acumen and mental prowess did not shield them from their ultimate lesson: Wealth and influence had no power over illness and tragedy.</p>

<p>The firm Murchison Brothers occupied the entire 23rd floor of the 50-story First National Bank Building, but the brothers kept a low profile.</p>

<p>The receptionist answered simply with, “Seven four one six oh three one.”</p>

<p>America believed that Clint Jr. owned the Cowboys. It was his creation and his passion. But like most of their ventures, it was owned with John.</p>

<p>“I think I bumped into John Murchison twice,” said Gil Brandt, Cowboys director of player personnel for 30 years.</p>

<p>“We thought Clint kept a low profile,” said columnist Blackie Sherrod. “What about John?”</p>

<p>Murchison Sr. thought an NFL team was a money loser — a small-time money loser.</p>

<p>On Christmas Eve 1967, he was startled by how much was at risk. At Gladoaks, he watched the TV news. His trademark cigarette holder was between his fingers and his cigarette had a lengthy ash. A reporter said Clint Jr. planned to move the Dallas Cowboys from the Cotton Bowl to Irving.</p>

<p>The new stadium would cost $15 million.</p>

<p>“That’s going to break that boy,” Murchison Sr. said.</p>

<p>Eighteen months later, as stadium construction began, Clint Murchison Sr. was hospitalized.</p>

<p>In the early morning hours of June 20, 1969, he told his servant Leon Williams, “I want to talk with Ginny. Leon, do you have a dime?”</p>

<p>Moments later, 74-year-old Clint Murchison Sr. was dead.</p>

<p class="subhead">The beachcomber</p>

<p>In the 1940s, teenager Clint Jr. set three lofty goals. 1. Attend MIT; 2. Be like his dad and buy a private island; 3. Own a pro football team.</p>

<p>In 1947, he earned his master’s in mathematics from MIT. His new bride, Jane Coleman Murchison, wore his Phi Beta Kappa key on a necklace.</p>

<p>In 1952, his offers for NFL teams were rejected.</p>

<p>His bid on a stunning tropical island in the Bahamas was not. It was 2½ miles long and named Spanish Cay.</p>

<p>Six lush beaches were protected from swells by a barrier reef a mile offshore. It had a dense grove of coconut palm trees — hundreds that reached 30 feet high and made a canopy. For the next two years, barges arrived with equipment and materials to build an isolated kingdom.</p>

<p>Clint III called the logistics daunting. “Everything,” he said, “was shipped over from the mainland of the United States.”</p>

<p>Dense vegetation was cut away and a 5,000-foot runway was built. A powerhouse was erected to hold generators. Cables for electricity and pipes for sewage and water were buried under a new central road. Uphill from the palm grove, the 14,000-square-foot main house was built with floor-to-ceiling windows.</p>

<p>Separate housing was built for servants.</p>

<p>Lambert’s, a Dallas landscape firm, added acres of St. Augustine grass.</p>

<p class="subhead">Rocky Mountain buy</p>

<p>In 1959, John Murchison found the opposite kind of retreat 100 miles west of Denver. He rode a tractor up a mountainside with his Yale classmate George Caulkins. At 11,000 feet, they looked at the valley below. Caulkins explained that it could be a mountain for snow skiing. John Murchison agreed. He became one of the original founders of the new resort.</p>

<p>It was called Vail.</p>

<p>Dallas architect Bud Ogelsby designed a five-story masterpiece for Lupe and John.</p>

<p>The top floor rested on a plateau. Below it, four more floors were suspended down a cliff that served as an interior wall. Masses of glass provided views in three directions.</p>

<p>As Clint Jr. hosted glamorous guests in the tropics, John did the same in the mountains. For years, he welcomed artists, financiers and President Gerald Ford.</p>

<p class="subhead">“He’s a no good …”</p>

<p>Also in 1959, Clint Jr. was in Miami in pursuit of his third goal. There, at an NFL owners’ meeting, the heads of the 12 teams tussled. Should they give the ambitious 36-year-old Clint Jr. an expansion team in Dallas.</p>

<p>The lead opponent was George Preston Marshall, owner of the Washington Redskins,</p>

<p>“The owners were like a poker group that played every Tuesday for 40 years,” said Brandt. “Why do we need anybody else?”</p>

<p>But Clint Jr. had a ruse to overcome Marshall.</p>

<p>He got his lobbyist, a heavy-set former FBI agent named Tom Webb, to buy the copyright to the Washington fight song, “Hail to the Redskins!”</p>

<p>In Miami, a polite Clint Jr. knocked on Marshall’s hotel door at 8 a.m.</p>

<p>“No one else would introduce us,” Clint Jr. said. “So here I am.”</p>

<p>“Say Clint,” Marshall said, “there’s a fellow working for you who has my song.”</p>

<p>“You’re kidding,” Clint Jr. said. “Who is it?”</p>

<p>Webb had been advised that a telephone charade was planned. From Marshall’s room, Clint Jr. called. Per instructions, Webb said nothing. His boss gave a one-man performance.</p>

<p>“If you’ll agree to let him have the rights to that song,” Clint Jr. said, “he’ll give us the vote. (Pause) I know you think he’s a no good son of a bitch, but this franchise means a lot to me. (Pause) Come on, Tom, be reasonable. I don’t know what he’s ever done to you, but please. (Pause) Oh, good Tom, I really appreciate your doing this. I really want to get into pro football.”</p>

<p class="subhead">The TV dollars</p>

<p>To the Murchisons, football was a balance-sheet asterisk.</p>

<p>But NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle planned to raise the stakes. The NFL would negotiate a high-dollar network TV contract and distribute the revenue evenly to every team.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1961, Cowboys GM Tex Schramm was the host on Spanish Cay. His guests included New York Giants co-owner Wellington Mara and 49ers executive Lou Spadia.</p>

<p>In New York, CBS Sports president Bill MacPhail, Schramm’s former boss, needed to make the deal with Rozelle.</p>

<p>The plan: CBS would pay $9.3 million to broadcast games.</p>

<p>“At about 6 at night, a ship-to-shore call comes that we got the TV contract,” said Brandt. “It was like we just won the lottery. The first thing we did was open the Dom Perignon.”</p>

<p>But the celebration was premature.</p>

<p>A federal judge ruled that the contract with one network was a violation of anti-trust laws. Within weeks, however, Rep. Emanuel “Manny” Cellar introduced a bill to exempt pro sports from a TV anti-trust conundrum.</p>

<p>With startling speed, it was approved by the House and Senate. In October 1961, President John F. Kennedy signed it. The CBS-NFL deal was reinstated.</p>

<p>Years later, it was revealed that days before introducing the bill, Celler’s law firm got $10,000 of business from Sweetwater Development in Dallas.</p>

<p>Controlling shareholders? Murchison Brothers.</p>

<p>One of Sweetwater’s incorporators? Edward W. LeBaron Jr., the 1961 starting quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys.</p>

<p>“I don’t think the NFL saw a power like Clint coming,” said Brandt.</p>

<p class="subhead">LBJ’s suite life</p>

<p>On Oct. 24, 1971, the Cowboys played their first game in the lavish new Texas Stadium.</p>

<p>There were 178 air-conditioned luxury Circle Suites. In them, high-dollar fans watched from comfy chairs as waiters served cocktails.</p>

<p>At the 50-yard line, Clint Jr. had a double suite. His brother John faced him from the opposite side of the stadium.</p>

<p>Democratic National Committee chairman Bob Strauss loved John’s suite. “Get me the hell out of here, Murchison,” he joked. “You’re ruining my reputation as a Democrat.”</p>

<p>The first season in Irving climaxed on Jan. 2, 1972, when the Cowboys played the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship Game.</p>

<p>Clint Jr., small and trim, wore his horn-rimmed glasses. Next to him was former President Lyndon Johnson in a dark pinstripe suit. Johnson had been a political favorite of the Murchisons since 1940.</p>

<p>During LBJ’s 1948 Senate run, aides like John Connally would visit Murchison Sr.’s Dallas house and oilman Sid Richardson’s private island for envelopes with up to $50,000 in campaign cash.</p>

<p>When the 1948 primary polls closed, opponent Coke Stevenson was ahead by 112 votes. Five days later, Alice, Texas, delivered new votes from Box 13. Johnson won the election by 87 votes and earned the nickname Landslide Lyndon.</p>

<p>The Box 13 count was thought to be a fraud, courtesy of South Texas political boss George Parr, known as the Duke of Duval County.</p>

<p>During the 1972 NFC Championship Game, the fourth quarter began with Dallas 7, San Francisco 3.</p>

<p>Johnson watched as quarterback Roger Staubach moved the Cowboys 80 yards. Just before the Cowboys’ touchdown, Clint Jr. leaned toward LBJ and said, “Here come the Duval County results.”</p>

<div class="imageBlock wideBlock clearFix">

</div>

<p class="subhead">And he speaks</p>

<p>Schramm had advised Clint Jr. not to befriend the players. “If that happens,” Schramm said, “then the players start complaining to the owner and there’s a problem right away.”</p>

<p>The inscrutable Clint Jr. had no problem with that.</p>

<p>After the NFC Championship game, he brought LBJ to the locker room. Johnson headed straight for Staubach to congratulate him.</p>

<p>But what really impressed the quarterback came later. Staubach went to the sink, covered his face with cream and began to shave when he felt a pat on the back.</p>

<p>He turned and saw the team owner.</p>

<p>“Great game,” said Clint Jr.</p>

<p>“It was a thrill for me,” said Staubach. “Clint never did that.”</p>

<p class="subhead">Exit strategy</p>

<p>As an antidote to his own shy ways, John traveled the world with his engaged, energetic wife, Lupe. Together, they collected art that shocked their Dallas friends — works by artists like Roy Lichtenstein, Kenneth Noland and their friend, Helen Frankenthaler. Their children would be left in the care of staff while they went to Africa or their home in Sydney, Australia.</p>

<p>For Clint Jr., his antidote was to run with a group of hard-drinking male friends.</p>

<p>He became a serial adulterer who bedded women at his New York and L.A. penthouses or any other place that was convenient.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1972, he found the Phi Beta Kappa key his wife wore around her neck on his bathroom sink. Jane Murchison filed for divorce.</p>

<p>At the office, John Murchison considered a similar move against his brother. Murchison Brothers’ debt had skyrocketed.</p>

<p>Their father had bet that inflation would raise the value of assets and decrease the value of debt.</p>

<p>“He was right about that,” John said. “The trick is to know when to get off the merry-go-round.”</p>

<p>By the late 1970s, interest rates began a frightening rise toward 20 percent.</p>

<p>John wanted out.</p>

<p>In 1978, he and Clint Jr. signed a dissolution agreement. It might take years to untangle, but Murchison Brothers would end.</p>

</div>

<p class="subhead">A father’s love</p>

<p>John’s emotional detachment from his own children was a different problem.</p>

<p>He made an effort with his youngest.</p>

<p>Barbara Jeanne Murchison graduated from his alma mater, Yale. She returned to Dallas and her fiancé, John Coffman.</p>

<p>In June 1979, she drove her parents to DFW International Airport so they could catch the supersonic Concorde to Paris.</p>

<p>Barbara walked inside with them.</p>

<p>Dressed in his trademark sports coat, John stood with his daughter and they stared through the window at the Concorde. As part of his attempt to quit smoking, he reached for a stick of gum.</p>

<p>When Barbara turned to leave, she was startled by his words.</p>

<p>“Do you have to go now?” he asked.</p>

<p>So, Barbara stayed.</p>

<p>Then, her glamorous parents boarded the Concorde and flew away.</p>

<p>A week later, they returned at 3 p.m. John had enough time to go home and change into a suit.</p>

<p>Outside was his silver Porsche 928, a Christmas surprise from Lupe.</p>

</div>

<p>He was the new president of the board of the Boy Scouts of America and committed to speak to 25 supporters at the Highland Park mansion of Gov. Bill Clements. He got in his car, drove south and pulled into the driveway of the Clements estate.</p>

<p>After dinner, John rose to speak. But soon, he stopped.</p>

<p>“I’m having difficulty breathing,” he said. “I’ll cut it short, if you don’t mind.”</p>

<p>Thirty-five years after its onset, his asthma still plagued him.</p>

<p>He sat down briefly and then left the room. Outside, Clements and King Ranch heir Bobby Shelton found him headed to the Porsche to go to the hospital. Clements asked State Trooper William Essler, part of the governor’s detail, to take him in a Highway Patrol car. Shelton got in the front passenger seat and John in the back.</p>

<p>At 9 p.m., Essler turned on his siren and red lights and pulled out past John’s parked Porsche.</p>

<p>He turned south on Preston. John lay down.</p>

<p>South of Armstrong Parkway, Preston Road morphed into Oak Lawn. There, John’s breathing became shallow. Concerned, Shelton got up on his knees and reached to loosen John’s tie.</p>

<p>With the siren blaring loudly, Essler ran the red light at Avondale.</p>

<p>A woman driving east went through the green light and hit the trooper’s passenger doors hard. The Highway Patrol car was shoved onto the median. Two of its wheels were bent.</p>

<p>Essler and Shelton had no injuries. John was unconscious.</p>

<p>Essler called an ambulance.</p>

<p class="subhead">Life’s intersection</p>

<p>John Coffman had just picked up Barbara Murchison for a party. In Coffman’s powder blue Mercedes sedan, the couple drove north on Oak Lawn. Near Avondale, they saw an ambulance and a terrible car wreck.</p>

<p>In the summer night air, the state troopers stood like statues.</p>

<p>“John, what happened?” B.J. asked her fiancé.</p>

<p>Coffman didn’t know. He drove on. Five blocks later, he turned left on Hawthorne and the couple went to the party. In 30 minutes, Barbara was called to the phone.</p>

<p>“Barbara Jeanne, you need to come to St. Paul,” said her sister Mary Noel Lamont. “Dad’s been in an accident.”</p>

<p>At the entrance to the ER, Barbara was met by her brother, John Murchison Jr. He told her the news.</p>

<p>Their father, age 57, had died from a heart attack.</p>

<p class="subhead">Nothing to say</p>

<p>Before John’s death, Clint Jr. had stopped drinking alcohol. With a new wife, he had focused on religion and become quite spiritual.</p>

<p>But in the material world, the dissolution agreement he’d signed with his brother was urgent.</p>

<p>Lupe and her children wished to disentangle John’s estate from Clint Jr.’s debts. As family acrimony increased, Clint Jr. began to wobble.</p>

<p>“I would watch him walk down the hall of the office for the restroom,” said his assistant Ruth Woodard. “He’d be touching the wall with this fingertips to keep his balance.”</p>

<p>“D-d-did you n-n-notice this didn’t start getting bad until I quit drinking?” he told a friend.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1983, Clint Jr. invited Tex Schramm to the big house on Forest Lane.</p>

<p>“I’ve got problems with that particular part of my brain, which gives me speech and equilibrium problems,” he said. “I will go through a slow but irreversible deterioration.”</p>

<p>Forbes magazine said Clint Jr. was worth $350 million. His creditors weren’t so sure.</p>

<p>The Dallas Cowboys, he told Schramm, were for sale.</p>

<p>The following year, Dallasite Bum Bright headed an investor group that bought the team and the stadium for $80 million.</p>

<p>“I negotiated with Tex Schramm,” said Jim Francis, who was operations officer of Bright and Company. “Clint was so ill, it was hard to understand his words.”</p>

<p>Half of the proceeds went to John’s side of the family, who were largely indemnified from litigation against Clint Jr.</p>

<p>Unable to speak or go the office, he filed for bankruptcy. His debts were about $400 million.</p>

<p>A trustee was charged with selling his assets.</p>

<p class="subhead">After dark</p>

<p>For 30 years, Clint Jr. added amenities to Spanish Cay. But he never installed runway lights.</p>

<p>Take-offs and landings were for daytime only.</p>

<p>During the bankruptcy, Robert Reinholm, son of the island manager, lived there in a staff house with its own generator.</p>

<p>There, 160 miles from Florida, Robert was alone.</p>

<p>One night, he awoke to the sound of airplanes. In a Jeep, he drove down the road Clint Jr. built in the 1950s. On the north end, he found all 5,000 feet of airstrip outlined by military-style portable lights.</p>

<p>Heavily armed drug traffickers spotted him. In a rare moment of drug-runner diplomacy, they signaled for him to shoo. Drugs were removed from planes and loaded on speedboats bound for the East Coast.</p>

<p>In Dallas, Clint Jr. was silent, unable to control sovereignty over anything but his thoughts.</p>

<p>On March 30, 1987, he died at age 63.</p>

<p class="subhead">Of things past</p>

<p>Clint Sr.’s widow, Virginia, was unaffected by the dissolution of Murchison Brothers and the bankruptcy of Clint Jr. She still owned every home she and Clint Sr. had occupied together. She traveled on her large Falcon 20 jet.</p>

<p>At Texas Stadium, she kept her 20-yardline suite.</p>

<p>In 1989, her guest there was Clint Murchison III. It was the worst season the Cowboys had experienced since 1960.</p>

<p>The new quarterback, Troy Aikman, was suited up. So was one of the last vestiges of the Murchison era: Ed “Too Tall” Jones.</p>

<p>The door of the suite opened and a voice said, “Clint, how are you?”</p>

<p>Like his father, Clint III was usually silent. But he turned and greeted the new owner of the Dallas Cowboys.</p>

<p>“Hello, Jerry,” he said.</p>

<p>For a few seconds, Jerry Jones and Clint Murchison III shook hands — Clint III, a family witness to the era of five Super Bowls and two Super Bowl wins.</p>

<p>Jones represented the era that had just arrived.</p>

<p>After the 1969 death of Murchison Sr., the vaqueros at Acuña built a 15-foot cross from two big pieces of wood.</p>

<p>They hauled it up the brushy path to the top of Mariquita Mountain. There, they could look down on Hacienda Acuña.</p>

<p>To secure the cross, a deep hole was dug.</p>

<p>In that hole, they placed a pair of his favorite boots. Then, they raised the cross.</p>

<p>On it, was an inscription: “Clint W. Murchison, Nunca nos olvidaremos de él!” [“We will never forget him.”]</p>

<p>For decades, the cross was visible from the house.</p>

<p>Finally, it was struck by lightning, burned and disappeared.</p>

<p>As a widow, Virginia entertained at Hacienca Acuña for 27 years. In 1996, she hosted a Thanksgiving gathering at the ranch with Clint Jr.’s sons Burk and Robert and their wives and children.</p>

<p>Burk climbed Mariquita.</p>

<p>“I found the remnants of the cross,” he said. “I found the brass stanchion that held it together and I brought it down.”</p>

<p>Returning to Dallas, Virginia fell ill. Four weeks later, on Christmas Day, she died.</p>

<p>In 2001, the family sold Acuña, one of the last physical manifestations of their grandfather’s empire. That year, Burk was the last Murchison to visit. He returned to secure a painting by Arthur Elliott that dominated the living room. It depicted a young and smiling Virginia Murchison in a colorful Mexican vestida.</p>

<p>“The painting,” said Burk, “is still in the family.”</p>
