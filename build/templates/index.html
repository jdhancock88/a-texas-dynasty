<p class="precede"><strong>First in a three-part sequel to Islands of the Oil Kings: </strong>At ranches, mansions and the Dallas Cowboys owners’ suite, Clint Murchison and his sons manifested prodigious wealth and profound tragedy. In Part 1, Britain’s oldest dynasty meets Texas’ newest at the Murchisons’ secluded kingdom in Mexico</p>

<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n the winter of 1950, even in oil-rich Houston, a private rail car was a rare talisman of affluence. Three private cars were majestic.</p>

<p>When the sun set on Feb. 2, a Chesapeake & Ohio passenger train braked gently as it carried the Duke and Duchess of Windsor into the station. In the cool night air, a crowd of excited Houstonians pressed against iron gates with their gazes fixed on the three polished steel cars at the end.</p>

<p>Inside was the duke, formerly King Edward VIII of England. With him was his twice-divorced American wife, Wallis Simpson. To marry her, he had surrendered the crown. After their wedding, she became a duchess. But the new king declined to give her a royal title.</p>

<p>Instead, due largely to her domineering personality and her obsession with fashion, she earned a Palm Beach title. She was the queen of café society. The duke was her king.</p>

<p>Though she had no crown, she traveled like a czarina. The train that arrived in Houston carried 104 pieces of the Duchess’ luggage including one black alligator-skin bag for her glittering emerald and diamond jewels.</p>

<p>They were unusual accessories for their destination.</p>

</div>

<p> The couple was headed deep into Mexico’s Sierra de Tamaulipas, the sparsely inhabited mountain range 70 miles northwest of Tampico.</p>

<p> Above 3,000 feet, mountain lions were plentiful. Humans were rare.</p>

<p> The exception was at Hacienda Acuna, the 100,000-acre kingdom of Dallas oilman Clint Murchison Sr. At its core was a limestone mansion designed by Jim Cheek, architect of Highland Park Village. In a valley nearby, a former pasture was graded and manicured into an airstrip.</p>

<p> Guests like Texas’ new senator, Lyndon Johnson, and actress Greer Garson, arrived aboard Murchison’s luxurious DC-3, the Flying Ginny. The plane could also ferry them to Isla del Toro, his private island off the coast of Tampico.</p>

<p> But the Windsors’ journey was not so simple, nor was it so private.</p>

<p> The duke and duchess were with their moneyed friend, C&O chairman Robert R. “Railroad” Young.</p>

<p> A Panhandle Texan-turned-East Coast aristocrat, Bob Young phoned Murchison in Dallas. The Duke and Duchess of Windsor wanted to see Acuna and Isla del Toro.</p>

<p> With his soft, East Texas lilt, Murchison said, “Great, I’ll have the Flying Ginny pick them up in New York.”</p>

<p> “That might be a problem,” Young said. “Wallis doesn’t fly.”</p>

<p> Instead, the couple boarded Young’s private cars in New York. As the train moved down the East Coast to Florida and across the Deep South, the journey became national news. Publications in the United States and Mexico guessed the net worth of the quiet Dallasite with a 100,000-acre Mexican ranch.</p>

<p> When the train stopped in Houston, a 42-year-old mustachioed oilman named Glenn McCarthy stood in front of about 2,500 spectators, to welcome the Windsors.</p>

<p> That night, he hosted a dinner for them at his hotel, the overtly opulent Shamrock. He was the man Edna Ferber fictionalized as Jett Rink in her Texas novel, Giant.</p>

<p> Bob Young and Clint Murchison were strictly nonfiction.</p>

<section class="contentWell">


  <p> Both were 5-foot-6, the antithesis of whom Hollywood might cast as powerful Texans.</p>

  <p> Murchison had more financial muscle than a Ferber giant. When Young needed $20 million for a Wall Street proxy war, he called “Murk.”</p>

  <p> That deal landed Murchison on the cover of Time magazine.</p>

  <p> It also signaled the launch of a Texas dynasty. Of his sons John and Clint Jr., Time said, “Around Dallas, they are known as Clint’s Whiz Kids.”</p>

  <p> A New York Times front-page story portrayed the brothers as swashbuckling financiers, masters of the “iron hand in the velvet glove.”</p>

  <p> At the peak of their wealth and influence, the Murchisons hosted guests at Acuna, three private islands, their California hotel, a Vail mansion, a Park Avenue penthouse and in the Dallas Cowboys’ owners’ box. FDR, Eisenhower, Lyndon Johnson, Gerald Ford, Ted Kennedy, Joe McCarthy, J. Edgar Hoover and John Connally were each guests in these worlds.</p>

  <p> But the nation had little knowledge of the Murchisons until the Windsor visit. Six weeks after the duke and duchess left the ranch, their trip was raised on the floor of the U.S. Senate.</p>

  <p> One senator clenched his fists and shouted. Blows were nearly exchanged. A controversial piece of natural gas legislation was up for a vote. But before the roll call, Hacienda Acuna, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor and the Shamrock were hurled as epithets—epithets against rich Texans.</p>

    <h3>A paradise called Acuna</h3>
    <p>After Clint Murchsion lost Matagorda Island in a coin flip with his former business partner Toddie Lee Wynne, he set off to find a new remote retreat: Acuna. More than 700 miles from Dallas, Murchison's new ranch covered 100,000 acres in Mexico’s  Tamaulipas highlands.</p>

<p class="subhead">A new Dallas society</p>


<p> Clint Murchison’s parallel arcs of dynasty and empire began their rise only after tragedy shattered his plan for an early retirement. At age 30, with a newly made oil fortune, he settled in San Antonio. He and his wife, Anne, planned a quiet life with their three boys. But seven months later, Anne was dead from hepatitis.</p>

<p> John was 4; Clint Jr., 2; and Burk, 1.</p>

<p> Their father was inconsolable. For a year, he would leave the children in nurse’s care and meander through Texas like a grieving Bedouin.</p>

<p> “When Anne died,” he said, “people said I stayed drunk for a year.”</p>

<p> But when Anne’s mother wanted to take the boys, he was jolted. He declined and stepped out of his internal darkness.</p>

<p> He moved 15 miles north of Dallas and built his first private world. In 1927, he purchased a 200-acre farm on Preston Road and moved in with the boys. It was a rural paradise near a growing metropolis. In 1936, his world was shaken again when 10-year-old Burk got pneumonia and died.</p>

</div>

<p> To dodge despair, he became a grand host. At the farm, he built a 22,000-square-foot manor house.</p>

<p> “We went out to see the fancy new house, which cost $250,000,” said the wife of one of his employees. “Everyone was scandalized.”</p>

<p> On a high ridge on the west bank of White Rock Creek, he carved an Olympic-size swimming pool and filled it from the land’s natural source, Keller Springs.</p>

<p> Under a canopy of oak and pecan trees, a new Texas aristocracy coalesced.</p>

<p> Stocky with a big head and large nose, Murchison looked like a retired boxer. But he walked with a light step and moved gracefully among his dozens of guests.</p>

<p> On weekends, waiters from the Adolphus Hotel joined the household staff and served dinners for 50 people.</p>

<p> On Fridays, Murchison’s boyhood best friend, fellow oilman Sid Richardson, would arrive from the West Texas oil fields in his maroon Chrysler. Other guests included Murchison’s lawyer/partner, Toddie Lee Wynne, and Dallas bankers Nathan Adams, R.L. Thornton and Fred Florence.</p>

<p> In the ’30s, he bought nine miles of Matagorda Island on the Texas Gulf coast as a new retreat. Richardson bought the island next door, San Jose. On the two islands, President Franklin Roosevelt became a Murchison/Richardson guest.</p>

<p> “Clint just had the blood of a pioneer,” recalled his pal Olin “”Olie” Lancaster. “Matagorda was not far enough away.”</p>

<p> At one of his gatherings, Murchison heard of a feudal-style ranch for sale in Mexico. The only access was on horseback.</p>

<p> It was called Acuna.</p>

<div class="imageBlock wideBlock clearFix">

</div>

<p class="subhead">Paradise found</p>


<p> During World War II, the Murchison businesses became enormous. The two people he cared for most were now beyond his reach. Eldest son John Murchison left Yale and became a fighter pilot in the Mediterranean and later, the China India Burma Theater. Clint Jr. left MIT and was in the Marines’ V-12 officer candidate school.</p>

<p> They were grown and they were gone. He’d dated the same woman for six years. At 47, decided to marry Virginia “Ginny” Long, 27. He was quiet, she was chatty. His suits were rumpled, almost shabby. Her dresses were elegant.</p>

<p> But she liked to hunt. She was an astute card player. She could easily mingle with his male friends.</p>

<p> But where?</p>

<p> Murchison and Toddie Lee Wynne separated their partnership and Wynne got Matagorda Island in a coin toss.</p>

<p> It was time to find <span class="gloss" data-entry="Acuña">Acuna</span>.</p>

<p> Murchison took his outgoing friend <span class="gloss" data-entry="Olin Lancaster">Olin Lancaster</span> with him to the Mexican village of Gonzalez. From there, they drove toward the Tamaulipas highlands. When the road ended, they rented small Oaxacan horses. The wooden saddles had been shaped with a knife and covered with cow hides—no padding.</p>

<p> Like explorers, they rode through a dense thorn forest, along sharp mountain ridges and into shrub-filled thickets.</p>

<p> But as they got into the mountains, the bake-oven temperature of Tamaulipas eased. The brown, dry vegetation of the lowlands disappeared. Spreading oaks were draped in Spanish moss. In a sheltered ravine, varied species of orchids bloomed.</p>

<p> When they stopped at the foot of Mariquita mountain, they saw an abandoned century-old ranch house.</p>

<p> They were at Acuna. The air was cool. The vegetation was lush.</p>

<p> “I have found the paradise of the world,” Murchison said.</p>

<p> Initially, he bought 75,000 acres. Later he added more.</p>

<p> Next, he brought Virginia.</p>

<p> The newlyweds spent the night in sleeping bags on the stone floor of the old house. “There was no roof,” she said. “The moon was so bright it lit up the mountains.”</p>

<div class="imageBlock sliderImage unslid">

  <p class="cutline">Murchison (left) hired Howard Reed (right) to build a road to his remote mountain ranch and to oversee construction of the entire compound. (Courtesy of the Murchison family)</p>
</div>

<p> Murchison hired a 22-year-old named Howard Reed. Industrious and bilingual, he was put in charge of building a mountain road.</p>

<p> “Here is my number,” Murchison said. “You have nothing to do with anyone except me. When I can get into Acuna by car, let me know.”</p>

<p> “I picked up a load of dynamite and other equipment,” Reed said. “I had 250 men at work on the road.”</p>

<p> Horace Rich, the English contractor who had built the Dallas mansion, oversaw construction of the main house. Limestone was quarried on the property and shaped by stonecutters. Pine and cedar was cut from Acuna’s forests for roof beams. A carpenter’s shop was built to make the floors, cabinets and furniture. Local clay was used on site to make the tile roof and floors.</p>

<p> On Reed’s new road, trucks hauled in generators for a powerhouse. Soon, the compound was electrified.</p>

<p> More refined products like an ice machine and plate-glass doors were delivered on Murchison’s airplane.</p>

<p> There, in a spacious valley at the foot of Mariquita, the former ghost ranch became a self-sufficient enterprise that employed dozens of locals. The main house was surrounded by a new stone wall with a massive entry gate. Inside the wall were modern buildings and staff housing, all with running water and electricity. New pickup trucks were parked near the corral. A grader cleared pastures of mesquite. Robust horses unlike any found in Tamaulipas were in the barn.</p>

<p> Most important to Murchison, it all sat in the migratory path of game birds. “I have the finest dove shooting south of Bangor, Maine, and north of Tierra del Fuego,” he said when inviting guests like Chase Manhattan chairman John J. McCloy.</p>

<p> A crew of vaqueros oversaw more than 5,000 head of cattle. “In my youth, I thought if I could be the largest cattle man, that would satisfy all my desires,” he said. “We have 5,000 or 6,000 head. That’s a long way from my aspirations.”</p>

<p> So, he added more. To the northwest in the border state of Coahuila, he bought the 150,000-acre Los Angeles Ranch and the 270,000-acre Tule Ranch.</p>

<p> Eventually, his Mexican holdings topped 500,000 acres.</p>

<p> But these were only outposts of his vast world.</p>

<p class="subhead">Can LBJ do it?</p>

<p> The epicenter was a non-descript two-story building in downtown Dallas at 1201 Main. Driving himself, Murchison would arrive at the office in a suit with no tie. In his left hand, a lit cigarette glowed from its holder. Once at his desk, his right hand would handle the telephone. By 1948, he controlled life insurance companies, banks, bus lines, steamships, pipelines, taxi companies, Henry Holt & Co. publishing and Field & Stream magazine.</p>

<p> On that phone, he talked business. After the war, he talked politics — lots of politics.</p>

<p> In the 1940 election, the Democratis’ House majority was in peril. Murchison and <span class="gloss" data-entry="Sid Richardson">Richardson</span> were part of a pipeline of money to <span class="gloss" data-entry="Lyndon Johnson">Rep. Lyndon Johnson</span> who dispersed it to congressional campaigns across the country. The Democrats won, their friend Sam Rayburn stayed as Speaker and Johnson was on the rise.</p>

<p> By 1948, Texas oil’s inncer circle knew Johnson had to win his race for the Senate. His primary opponent, former Gov. Coke Stevenson, was too independent for their tastes.</p>

<p> <span class="gloss" data-entry="John Connally">John Connally</span> and other LBJ lieutenants repeatedly visited Murchison, Richardson, Amon Carter and George and Herman Brown to collect envelopes stuffed with cash —cash that was never reported.</p>

<p> How much?</p>

<p> “A hell of a lot,” Connally said.</p>

<p> Often, there was $50,000 in a single envelope.</p>

<p> “It was the dawn of a whole new era in politics,” Connally said.</p>

<p> In the primary, Johnson beat Stevenson by an infamous 87 votes and earned the nickname “Landslide Lyndon.”</p>

<p> In 1948, Republicans did not win statewide office in Texas.</p>

<p> On Jan. 3, 1949, Lyndon Johnson was sworn in as a U.S. senator.</p>

<p> Six months later, he thrilled his benefactors by ending the career of one an FDR New Dealer who regulated the price of natural gas. It was rare for a freshman senator to chair a subcommittee. But Johnson asked the Interstate Commerce Committee chairman if he might run the subcommittee that would oversee the nomination of Federal Power Commission chairman Leland Olds for a third term. The request was granted.</p>

<p> In Olds’ view, the price of natural gas prices had to be kept down for consumers.</p>

<p> Murchison, Richardson, Carter and Houston’s Brown brothers believed that if LBJ got rid of Olds, their profits would increase enormously.</p>

<p> It “would put something in their pockets,” Connally said. “This was a real bread-and-butter issue to these oilmen.”</p>

<p> It was the year that China became a communist state and the Soviets exploded their first nuclear weapon. It was 1949 Red-Scare America. Suspected Communists were ostracized.</p>

<p> As he prepared his subcommittee, Johnson decided Leland Olds just might be red.</p>

<p> During the hearings, LBJ’s long-time Texas attorney Ed Clark knew Olds was no Communist. But his wealthiest client, Clint Murchison, wanted Olds out.</p>

<p> Clark told LBJ biographer Robert Caro that Johnson “would call early in the morning—‘Communists! Communists!’ [Expletive]. Communists had nothing to do with this, and he knew it.” During the hearing, he told LBJ secretary Mary Rather, “I don’t care anything about these Communists. I wouldn’t look under the bed for Communists but I might look down there and hope I would find a blonde. The only reason I am interested in this hearing is on account of Mr. Murchison.”</p>

<p> The Senate rejected Leland Olds 53-15.</p>

<p class="subhead">Sid’s island victory</p>

<p> At the time of the hearings, <span class="gloss" data-entry="Acuña">Hacienda Acuna</span> was in prep mode to receive the former king of England.</p>

<p> But first, Murchison had to congratulate a 41-year-old senator.</p>

<p> With the words <span class="gloss" data-entry="The Flying Ginny">“Flying Ginny”</span> painted above its windows, Murchison’s big DC-3 descended near Corpus Christi and landed six miles across the bay on <span class="gloss" data-entry="Sid Richardson">Richardson’s</span> San Jose Island.</p>

<p> In that private kingdom, a weeklong victory party was planned for <span class="gloss" data-entry="Lyndon Johnson">LBJ</span>. As a sign of how quickly Johnson had risen, Sen. Richard Russell of Georgia, one of the most powerful men in the Capitol, came with him.</p>

<p> In the modernist mansion designed by O’Neil Ford, there were meals by a chef flown in from New Orleans. Trays were filled with complimentary cigarettes. The staff refilled cocktail glasses for guests like Amon Carter and Herman Brown.</p>

<p> Dick Russell was considering a presidential run in 1952. His fellow guests could help finance it.</p>

<p> That was just Part 1.</p>

<p> Part 2 came just days later. After Johnson and Russell left the island, war hero Dwight Eisenhower arrived. The previous year, the general refused to run for president. Would he run in 1952? Murchison and Richardson were ready to put some of their chips on it.</p>

<p class="subhead">The royal ascent</p>

<p>Farther south at <span class="gloss" data-entry="Acuña">Acuna</span>, Neiman Marcus linen towels embroidered with the Windsor crest were placed in the bathrooms. The Mexican household staff learned to serve tea. None could say “duke” or “duchess.” Jose the butler said “El Rey” and “La Reina”—the king and the queen.</p>

<p> On an early Sunday morning, the three private rail cars arrived in Gonzalez. About 800 locals stood in the rain to greet the <span class="gloss" data-entry="The Duke of Windsor">Windsors</span>, who were with Bob Young and his wife, Anita, sister of artist Georgia O’Keeffe.</p>

<p> Acuna vaqueros loaded ranch trucks with 150 pieces of Windsor luggage, many bearing the decal “Cunard White Star, First Class.”</p>

<p> The path where Murchison and <span class="gloss" data-entry="Olin Lancaster">Olin Lancaster</span> had first gone on horseback now had a road—a primitive, winding, bumpy road. As the royal procession started its climb, a circling Murchison plane buzzed the ranch. Because there was no telephone, the crew dropped a roll of toilet paper as a signal. The duke and duchess should arrive around noon.</p>

<div class="imageBlock sliderImage unslid">

</div>

<p> The 32-mile journey took more than three hours, but the Windsors and Youngs arrived early.</p>

<p> <span class="gloss" data-entry="Virginia Murchison">Virginia Murchison</span> was in the kitchen with curlers still in her hair. In his white waiter’s jacket, Jose the butler said loudly, “El Rey!” She looked up and into the deep blue eyes and smiling face of the Duke of Windsor.</p>

<p> The couple was shown to their wing where the Acapulco, Taxco and Cuernavaca rooms were ready. Each room opened onto the patio and interior courtyard.</p>

<p> Within moments, the window to the duchess’ bathroom was open. She held out one of the Neiman Marcus hand towels with the Windsor logo and waved. “They’re marvelous,” she said.</p>

<p> Once settled, <span class="gloss" data-entry="Wallis Simpson">Wallis Windsor</span> appeared on the verandah dressed for a Palm Beach garden party in a pleated tartan skirt, navy blouse, designer sweater, a strand of large pearls and a pair of diamond earrings.</p>

<p> The duke wore yellow trousers with a matching sweater and rust-colored ascot.</p>

<p> Even Clint Murchison looked stylish in a new taupe suit with a silk handkerchief. (<span class="gloss" data-entry="Sid Richardson">Richardson</span> spent years kidding his friend about the suits he had made to host the couple.)</p>

<p> For the duke, Acuna was like a scene from his childhood. It was a private retreat where he shot pheasant, quail and turkey.</p>

<p> And the remoteness proved no hindrance to the duchess’ needs.</p>

<p> After the first night, Virginia received a hand-written note from the duchess: “Dear Mrs. Murchison, If a plane is going to Tampico tomorrow afternoon, may I send my maid and the valet? I have a case that the handle has come off of which they can have arranged there.”</p>

<p> Next, she wanted her hair done.</p>

<p> “We sent our plane over to Tampico to pick up a hairdresser,” Virginia said.</p>

<p> But the duchess could also be handy. On a cool night when the furnace was not working, the always-slim Wallis Windsor squeezed into the utility room and relit the pilot.</p>

<p> After several days of ranch life, the Windsor motorcade was reassembled to take them down the mountain and across the countryside to the Gulf coast. There, Murchison boats took the whole party to the home on <span class="gloss" data-entry="Isla del Toro">Isla del Toro</span>. For the entire ride, Clint Murchison clutched a black alligator bag.</p>

<p> “What’s in that suitcase?” Virginia asked.</p>

<p> “Wally’s jewels,” he said.</p>

<p class="subhead">The Ayes of Texas</p>

<p> Ten days after the duke surprised <span class="gloss" data-entry="Virginia Murchison">Virginia Murchison</span> in the <span class="gloss" data-entry="Acuña">Acuna</span> kitchen, the <span class="gloss" data-entry="The Duke of Windsor">Windsors</span> were gone. They were chauffeured to Mexico City by Howard Reed so they could meet with President Miguel Aleman.</p>

<p> Following behind were ranch trucks with all the luggage. To the later surprise of Virginia Murchison, one bag contained the 12 Neiman Marcus towels with the Windsor crest.</p>

<p> Clint Murchison boarded the <span class="gloss" data-entry="The Flying Ginny">Flying Ginny</span> and returned to Dallas. There, with his telephone, he could follow the LBJ-sponsored bill to deregulate the price of natural gas.</p>

<p> A champion of the plan was Texas’ senior senator, 72-year-old Tom Connally who came to the Senate in 1929.</p>

<p> On the other side of the aisle was the bill’s loudest opponent. He was Illinois’ Sen. Paul Douglas, a noted economist and World War II Marine.</p>

<p> “The eyes of the nation are on this Senate,” Douglas said, “the eyes of 12 million housewives who pay for cooking and heating gas with scanty pocketbooks—the families of little people who cannot pay the money to dine and dance at the Shamrock Hotel in Houston or entertain the Duke and Duchess of Windsor at 100,000-acre ranch but who…”</p>

<p> “Will the senator yield!” Connally yelled.</p>

<p> The senator would not.</p>

<p> Connally, with long white hair, vested suit and bow tie, looked like what he had been — a 19th-century man.</p>

<p> He stalked across the Senate floor and shouted, “What’s that got to do with the gas bill?”</p>

<p> Just 10 feet from a startled Douglas, the old Texan clenched and unclenched his fists. He yelled, “That’s a gratuitous insult to my state and I resent it.”</p>

<p> For <span class="gloss" data-entry="Lyndon Johnson">Lyndon Johnson</span>, it was theater. He’d done the math.</p>

<p> The deregulation bill passed 44 to 38.</p>

<p> In Texas, some pondered if LBJ might go all the way to the White House.</p>

<p> “It occurs to me that a good Democrat could still be elected in 1952,” Murchison wrote to him. “There is no need to keep a good horse under the blankets forever.”</p>

<p class="notes"><strong>PART 2:</strong> At the beginning of the Eisenhower presidency, Clint Murchison opened the Hotel Del Charro in La Jolla, Calif. It became a summer retreat for J. Edgar Hoover, Richard Nixon and hard-drinking Red hunter Joe McCarthy.</p>
